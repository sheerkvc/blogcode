3. is moving towards computer post-graduate, strive to climb to a higher level

### Ⅱ: Why I came here

Since 2020, which is the first time I came to a normal high school, I have developed little interest in computer. Although I was admitted to this school's recommendation, I couldn't irrigate too much time and energy on it cos some reasons we all know. After entering collage, finally a lot of time is empty for me to find what I truly loved and things needs to seek. That's why I decided to dig deeper into magic code world.

芜湖！这里是Kevin Chen。如你所见，这是我的blog，在我之后的网络时间中，我将在这里分享一些关于学习相关的总结和心路历程，也将会花更多的时间去仔细地提升和拓展这个博客。

### 关于这个家伙

1. 一名在校的普通大学生
2. 喜欢编程，折腾安卓手机，体验不同的生态
3. 正在朝着计算机考研努力，爬到更高的水平

### 我为什么来到这

在我在2020年进入了一所普通的高中的时候，我已经对计算机产生了一点点兴趣，虽然考上了重点班，但因为一些众所周知的原因我也不能在这方面花费太多的时间和精力。在进入大学之后，我终于有了充足的时间去·寻找真正喜欢和值得追求的东西。这也是我为什么想去探索代码世界的原因。

### 我的性格

在我的原则里，这也是我对自己的要求

我诉之于知音

我对从善之人微笑

我对虚伪之人保持距离

我给真正朋友一切也共同承担痛苦

以眼还眼，以牙还牙，后于恶意

### 最后

明显的，这是一个我的小世界，我也希望在你看到这小小的博客时，能放慢脚步，找到一个宁静之地。共勉！
